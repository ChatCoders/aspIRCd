******************************* IMPORTANT *************************************

  *********** Note for those who dont bother reading docs *****************
  * - Reading INSTALL is now a must, as the old DPATH is now specified    *
  *   when configure is run.                                              *
  *   You now need to ./configure --prefix="/path/to/install/it"          *
  *   to specify the path that will be installed with your ircd!          *
  *************************************************************************

  ALSO, IF YOU ARE UPGRADING YOUR CURRENT SOURCE TREE, AND YOU TRY TO BUILD
  IN IT WITHOUT PERFORMING AT LEAST 'make clean', THINGS _WILL_ BREAK.  IT IS
  RECOMMENDED THAT YOU RUN 'make distclean' AND THEN RERUN './configure'!

******************************* REQUIREMENTS **********************************

Necessary Requirements:

- A supported platform (look below)

- A working dynamic load library.

- A working lex.  Solaris /usr/ccs/bin/lex
  appears to be broken, on this system flex
  should be used.


Feature Specific Requirements:

- For SSL Clients, SSL Challenge controlled OPER feature, and encrypted server links,
  a working OpenSSL library or GnuTLS library.  CHALLENGE is not supported on GnuTLS
  yet.

- For encrypted oper and (optional) server passwords, a working DES, MD5, or SHA library
  implementing crypt().

- To report bugs in charybdis, visit us at irc.atheme.org #charybdis

- See the INSTALL document for info on configuring and compiling
  charybdis.

- Please read doc/index.txt to get an overview of the current documentation.

- The files, /etc/services, /etc/protocols, and /etc/resolv.conf, SHOULD be
  readable by the user running the server in order for ircd to start with
  the correct settings.  If these files are wrong, charybdis will try to use
  127.0.0.1 for a resolver as a last-ditch effort.

- FREEBSD USERS: if you are compiling with ipv6 you may experience
  problems with ipv4 due to the way the socket code is written.  To
  fix this you must: "sysctl net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0"

- SOLARIS USERS: this code appears to tickle a bug in older gcc and 
  egcs ONLY on 64-bit Solaris7.  gcc-2.95 and SunPro C on 64bit should
  work fine, and any gcc or SunPro compiled on 32bit.

- DARWIN AND MACOS X USERS: You must be using at least the December 2001
  Development Tools from Apple to build charybdis with shared modules.
  Before then you MUST disable shared modules, as we do not have the proper
  flags for cc(1) prior to that point to produce shared modules.

- SUPPORTED PLATFORMS: this code should compile without any warnings on:
    Debian 9
    Ubuntu 18.04
    CentOS Latest Version
    FreeBSD uptill latest version
    Solaris uptill latest version
  
  Please let us know if you find otherwise.  
  It probably does not compile on AIX, IRIX or libc5 Linux.

- TESTED PLATFORMS:  The code has been tested on the following platforms, and
  is known to run properly.
  Debian 9  
  Ubuntu 18.04
  CentOS uptill latest version
  Fedora uptill latest version
  Solaris Uptill Latest Version
  NetBSD Uptill Latest Version

- This code has been primarily updated and should compile on every version of
Operating sytem.
You are free to report bugs.
